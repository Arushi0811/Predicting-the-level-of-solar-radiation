# SOLAR-RADIATION-PREDICTION
-by Arushi Mahwar, student from Birla Institute Of Technology, Mesra, Jaipur campus

This is my project on machine learning.
Languages included : Python
Goal : To predict the level of solar radition from the measurements from the past 4 months

This project has the following parts:

A. Data Visualization : In this I pre processed the raw data into a meaningful numeric data and plot some graph for better understanding.

B. Applying the linear regression model: (i) Train-Test split - split the data into 3 sets: training, validation and testing.
                                      (ii) Model Building - drawing the intercept and plotting the data.
